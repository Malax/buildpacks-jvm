#  Heroku Cloud Native Gradle Buildpack

Note: This is not a _native_ Cloud Native Buildpack yet. Releases of this buildpack are created by shimming classic
[Heroku Gradle buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-gradle) releases via
[cnb-shim](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-shim).

The code in this directory will only turn into a valid buildpack during the release process. To use this buildpack, use
the release on the official Cloud Native Buildpack registry.
